------------------------- MyBurger -------------------------


## Description

MyBurger is the project which is based on the Burger project on the Udemy course of Maximilian Schwarzmüller: React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux), course url: https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/.
In this project I've adjust some use cases, but the core concept is unchanged.

This project demonstrates a web apps to serve the clients order their favourite burger by the fascinating way on their own ( I just used CSS to illustrate the burger and its ingredients: bacon, cheese, meat and salad ), then checkout and order. I also added the user functions (Sign in and Sign out) to this project.

All the project is just focus on front-end process, back-end I simply used Firebase as an awesome server to store my necessary data.

## Goals

This project is the good way to deep dive in React, I've learned a lot :
- Understand the 'create-react-apps' structure.
- Deep dive in React component: props and state, life cycles hook,...
- HTTP requests with 'axios'.
- React routing.
- Form validations & Authentications.
- And of course, use 'redux' to manage states.

## How to run

I used 'create-react-app' to build, so all the 'npm' commands is the same as default:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Future works

In future, I will continue to add more new features such as: Feedback, Order more than 1 burger, more combo options,... as the way to improve my React skill.
